# Infinite Comic Plugin
========

## Roadmap

- Create custom post type for "**story**"
	- Design a custom page for this 
		- Title
		- Featured image
		- Chapter
		- Notes
		- ~~Comments~~

- Create Taxonomies for "**Chapters**"
	- These will separate the story into sections, so when you're reading back, you can go to section X without needing to scroll to it.
	- Chapters don't dictate the order of the posts, the posts are chronological. So the post date determines the order.

- Social share the post
